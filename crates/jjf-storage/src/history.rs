//! Per-issue op-by-op timeline reconstructed from the `Jjf-Op:` trailer
//! chain on the `issues` bookmark.
//!
//! Given an issue id, returns one [`HistoryEntry`] per op, in commit
//! order (oldest first). A commit that carries multiple ops (e.g. the
//! create-time multi-op stanza of spec §5.7, or a single-call close +
//! label-add) emits one entry per op — all sharing the same `commit`,
//! `author`, and `timestamp`, with the op-specific payload in `op`.
//!
//! The trailer parser is shared with `read.rs`'s debug-build
//! cross-check (see `trailer.rs`) — the consolidation is the whole
//! point of this module.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This is the per-issue stream. A whole-bookmark audit log
//! (every issue, every op) is a separate ticket.

///
/// `timestamp` is the commit's **author timestamp** formatted as
/// `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (UTC, second resolution). This is what jj
/// stamps on the commit when the writer's `jj new bookmarks(issues)`
/// lands; it's distinct from (and may differ by a fraction of a second
/// from) the writer's own `now_rfc3339()` that lands in the on-disk
/// record's `created_at` / `updated_at`. See spec §5 and the closing
/// comment on `b650d74` for why the two clocks don't always agree.
///
/// `jjf_at` is the value of the optional `Jjf-At:` trailer (RFC 3339
/// with nanosecond precision, UTC, set by the writer at the moment of
/// the op). Stanzas predating the spec §5 op-time bump return `None`;
/// the op-space merge driver's ordering tuple treats those as older
/// than any stamped op at the same `timestamp` second.
///
/// `author` is rendered as `Name <email>` by jj's `author` template
/// field, matching git's standard. May be empty if no jj user is
/// configured (e.g. throwaway test repos with no `user.name`).
