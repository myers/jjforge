//! `jjf` — the jjforge CLI binary.
//!
//! This crate is the user-facing entry point for jjforge: a thin
//! clap-derive harness over the typed APIs in `jjf-storage`. Each
//! sub-verb (`new`, `show`, `ls`, `update`, `comment`, `close`,
//! `open`, `label`, `init`) maps to one storage call (or, for stubs,
//! a `not yet implemented` placeholder so the parser surface is
//! visible from day one).
//!
//! # Exit-code convention
//!
//! Every verb honors the same exit codes — later verbs MUST follow
//! the same rule:
//!
//! - `0` — success.
//! - `1` — runtime failure (storage error, IO error, anything that's
//!   "we tried, it didn't work").
//! - `2` — argument or preflight failure (bad flags, missing input,
//!   "this isn't a jj repo"). Surfaces with a clear stderr line so a
//!   shell pipeline can react to it without parsing stdout.
//!
//! `--json` is a global flag accepted by every verb. For verbs that
//! haven't been implemented yet, the flag is parsed but ignored
//! (they error out the same way regardless). For `init`, the JSON
//! output is `{"ok": true, "bookmark": "bugs"}` per the
//! `cli-skeleton` ticket.
//!
//! # What lives here vs. `jjf-storage`
//!
//! All the actual work — the 4-CLI dance, the trailers, the merge
//! policy — lives in `jjf-storage` (and, for conflict-resolution,
//! `jjf-merge`). This crate's only jobs are: parse args, hand the
//! parsed shape to storage, render the result, map errors to exit
//! codes. No business logic.
